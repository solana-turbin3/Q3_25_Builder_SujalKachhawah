# Q3 2025 Solana Builder - Sujal Kachhawah

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Solana blockchain development projects and learning materials, organized as part of the Q3 2025 Builder program.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔗 `anchor/`
Collection of Anchor-based Solana programs demonstrating various DeFi and blockchain concepts:

- **`amm/`** - Automated Market Maker (AMM) implementation for decentralized token swapping
- **`dice-game/`** - On-chain dice game with randomness and betting mechanics
- **`escrow/`** - Secure escrow program for trustless transactions between parties
- **`marketplace/`** - NFT marketplace with listing, buying, and selling functionality
- **`nft-staking/`** - NFT staking protocol with rewards distribution
- **`vault/`** - Secure token vault for deposits, withdrawals, and fund management

Each Anchor project includes:
- Smart contract programs written in Rust
- TypeScript test suites
- Deployment configurations
- Build artifacts

### 🚀 `prereqs/`
Foundational learning materials and prerequisite exercises:

- **`rs-prereq/`** - Rust prerequisites
- **`ts-prereq/`** - TypeScript prerequisites  

### 🌟 `solana-starter/`
Starter for Q3 Builder Program

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own setup instructions. Generally:

1. **For Anchor projects**: Navigate to the specific project folder and run `anchor build` and `anchor test`
2. **For TypeScript examples**: Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. **For Rust projects**: Use `cargo build` and `cargo test`

## 📚 Learning Path

1. Start with `prereqs/` to understand basic concepts
2. Explore `solana-starter/` for practical examples
3. Dive into `anchor/` projects for advanced implementations

## 🔧 Development Environment

- Solana CLI tools
- Anchor framework
- Node.js and TypeScript
- Rust toolchain

This repository serves as a proof of work for Solana development and the builders program, demonstrating fundamental blockchain development skills from basic wallet operations to DeFi protocols.
